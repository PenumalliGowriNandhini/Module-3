REGEX - PATTERN MATCHING USING REGEX
# AIM
To write a Python program that matches a string containing an 'a' followed by two to three 'b' characters using regular expressions.

# ALGORITHM
1.Begin the program.

2.Accept a string str1 from the user.

3.Define the regular expression pattern as r"[a]+b{2,3}".

4.Use the re.match() function to check if the string str1 matches the pattern.

5.If a match is found, print "Found a match!".

6.If no match is found, print "Not matched!".

7.Terminate the program.
# PROGRAM
```
# REGNO:-212222060175
# Name:-Penumalli GowriNandini
import re
str=input()
x=re.search("bb",str)
if x:
    print("Found a match!")
else:
    print("Not matched!")
```
